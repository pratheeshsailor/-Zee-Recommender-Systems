UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp

UserIDs range between 1 and 6040

MovieIDs range between 1 and 3952

Ratings are made on a 5-star scale (whole-star ratings only)

Each user has at least 20 ratings

MOVIES FILE DESCRIPTION

=========================================================================

Movie information is in the file "movies.dat" and is in the following format:

MovieID::Title::Genres

Titles are identical to titles provided by the IMDB (including year of release)

Genres are pipe-separated and are selected from the following genres:

Action

Adventure

Animation

Children's

Comedy

Crime

Documentary

Drama

Fantasy

Film-Noir

Horror

Musical

Mystery

Romance

Sci-Fi

Thriller

War

Western

Concepts Tested:

Recommender Engine

Collaborative Filtering (Item-based & User-based Approach)

Pearson Correlation

Nearest Neighbors using Cosine Similarity

Matrix Factorization

What does “good” look like?

Reading the data files, formatting them into a proper workable format and merging the data files into one single dataframe

Eg: pd.read_fwf('../input/zeemovie/movies.dat', encoding='ISO-8859-1'
Performing exploratory data analysis like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset and cleaning the data

Performing feature engineering steps type conversions and deriving new features like ‘Release Year’

Visualizing the data with respect to different categories to get a better understanding of the underlying distribution

Grouping the data in terms of Average Rating and No. of Ratings given

Creating a pivot table of movie titles & user id and imputing the NaN values with a suitable value

Follow the Item-based approach and

Pearson Correlation

Take a movie name as input from the user

Recommend 5 similar movies based on Pearson Correlation

Cosine Similarity

Print the item similarity matrix and user similarity matrix

Example: An user-user similarity matrix just for demonstration.

Create a CSR matrix using the pivot table.[Optional, This is an extended approach, link to example implementation].

Write a function to return top 5 recommendations for a given item

[sklearn optional] Take a movie name as user input and use KNN algorithm to recommend 5 similar movies based on Cosine Similarity. [link to sklearn Nearest Neighbor documentation]


Matrix Factorization

Use cmfrec/Surprise library to run matrix factorization. (Show results with d=4).

Evaluate the model’s performance using RMSE and MAPE.

Bonus - how can you do a train test split for MF?

Embeddings for item-item and user-user similarity

Re-design the item-item similarity function to use MF embeddings (d=4) instead of raw features

Similarly, do this for user-user similarity

Bonus: Get d=2 embeddings, and plot the results. Write down your analysis from this visualisation. (Compare with other visualization techniques)

Follow the User-based approach (Optional)

Ask the user to rate a few movies and create a dataframe of the user’s choices.

Find other users who’ve watched the same movies as the new user.

Sort the old users by the count of most movies in common with the new user.

Take the top 100 users and calculate a Similarity Score for each user using the Pearson Correlation function.

Get the top 10 users with the highest similarity indices, all the movies for these users, and add Weighted movie Ratings by Multiplying the Rating to the Similarity Index.

Calculate the average recommendation score by dividing the Weighted Rating by the Similarity Index and select movies with the highest score i.e., 5.

Now, recommend 10 movies based on the ratings given by old users who are similar to the new user.

Evaluation Criteria (100 points)

Define Problem Statement and Formatting the Data (20 points)

Definition of the problem (as per the given problem statement with additional views)

Evaluate the model in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error

Use embeddings for visualization and similarity-based models.

Build a Recommender System based Pearson Correlation. (Optional)

Use the User-based approach to create a recommender system that uses Pearson Correlation

70s b. 90s c. 50s d.80s

The movie with maximum no. of ratings is ___.

Name the top 3 movies similar to ‘Liar Liar’ on the item-based approach.

On the basis of approach, Collaborative Filtering methods can be classified into ___-based and ___-based.

Pearson Correlation ranges between ___ to ___ whereas, Cosine Similarity belongs to the interval between ___ to ___.

Mention the RMSE and MAPE that you got while evaluating the Matrix Factorization model.
